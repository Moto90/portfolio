Moatasem Sorour | Portfolio
Hello and welcome to my professional portfolio! This repository hosts the source code for my personal website, a showcase of my skills, projects, and professional journey as an IT Support Professional and Web Developer.

The design is a modern, clean, and highly functional aesthetic inspired by GitHub's dark theme, with a focus on readability and smooth user experience.

‚ú® Key Features
Responsive Design: Optimized for a seamless experience on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop displays.

Dynamic Typing Effect: An engaging and personalized greeting on the homepage.

Interactive Project Gallery: A dedicated section to showcase my projects. Clicking on a project photo opens a dynamic, dark-themed modal slideshow to view more detailed screenshots.

Professional Layout: Clear and organized sections for my "About Me," "Skills," and "Contact" information.

Clean & Modern UI: A custom-designed dark theme with a focus on polished hover effects, subtle animations, and a professional color palette.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure and semantic content.

CSS3: Custom styling, including Flexbox and Grid for modern layouts. The design incorporates a custom color palette and responsive media queries.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Implemented for all interactive functionality, including the homepage typing effect and the project gallery's pop-up slideshow logic.
